\subsection{Comments about the module}
FSE is the only Computer Science module I have taken so far that actually uses paper and printouts. These pages are a pain to organise and unlike digital documents can't be edited easily or backed up. 

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

I haven't taken a selfie with Max so instead here is an image of Steve Bagley that I have taken from Google.  

\begin{figure}[h]
\caption{Steve Bagley}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Bagley.jpg}
\label{fig:selfie}
\end{figure}

%You can then use the label of the figure to reference it later with the command ${\backslash}ref.$ you can comment out the next line to see an example of how it works.

% My selfie with Max is in  Figure~\ref{fig:selfie}.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
I have learnt that I don't work well with strict deadlines.
